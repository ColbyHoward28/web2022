      <h2> MY MUSIC PRODUCTION JOURNEY </h2>
      <p> Back in 2019 I became very fascinated with the new trending sounds
      of mucic. I have always had an ear for music but am very well experienced
      with some of the software that is used when making beats. Fast forward to 2022
      I have so much fun putting sounds together and creating new sounds! </p>

      to lease a beat it will cost 80 dollats. Wav audio forms are 220 dollars and MP3 is regular prices. Sales will be 
      available randomly and very often because my beats store is affordable for Everyone who wants to make music and perfect their craft.</p>
